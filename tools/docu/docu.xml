            <summary>
            Base class of all spark views. In this example it's named in the
            web.config spark/pages/@pageBaseType attribute. 
            
            If you use #latebound syntax in expressions you need to have Eval
            methods in the base class, and with direct usage it's a
            "bring your own Eval" situation.
            
            For convenience this example will rely on the ViewDataDictionary.
